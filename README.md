1. Save a copy of `k9t9.properties-example`.
```
cp k9t9.properties-example ~/k9t9.properties
```

2. Update settings, such as key code mappings.

    For example, to map Android key code `4` to the `DELETE` function:
    ```
    key.DELETE=4
    ```
3. Copy the updated settings file to your device using `adb`
```
adb push ~/k9t9.properties /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.shortendesign.k9keyboard/files/k9t9.properties
```
You will need to restart the IME service for the settings to take effect (restarting your device may
be the simplest way).

To remove the custom settings file:
```
adb shell rm /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.shortendesign.k9keyboard/files/k9t9.properties
```
